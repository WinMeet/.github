## Coding Standards
To ensure code consistency, maintainability, and readability across the project, we are following coding standards below:

- Naming conventions:
  - We use "camelCase" for variables and function names.
  - We use "PascalCase" for class and enum names.
  - We name files using "snake_case".
- Code modularization:
  - We break down our code into smaller, reusable components or functions.
  - We organize code into folders based on feature.
- Error handling:
  - We catch exceptions and provide meaningful error messages to users when necessary.
